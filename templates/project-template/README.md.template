# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

An x402 protocol integration built with x402-devkit. This project demonstrates both buyer (client) and seller (server) implementations using the x402 payment protocol.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Fund Your Wallet

Your development wallet has been created automatically. You need to fund it with test tokens:

```bash
npm run fund
```

Follow the instructions to get:
- **Base Sepolia ETH** (for gas fees)
- **USDC test tokens** (for making payments)

### 2. Run Examples

**As a Buyer (Client):**
```bash
npm run buyer
```
This demonstrates making paid API requests using x402.

**As a Seller (Server):**
```bash
npm run seller
```
This starts a server with paid endpoints protected by x402.

## 🔑 Wallet Management

Your development wallet is stored in `.x402/wallet.json` and is automatically:
- ✅ Generated with cryptographic randomness
- ✅ Encrypted for security
- ✅ Gitignored to prevent accidental commits

**⚠️ Important:** This wallet is for development only. Never use it for real funds!
